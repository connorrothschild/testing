  <h2>
    <p>COMPAS—Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions—is a criminal justice algorithm meant to assess potential recidivism risk and assist judges in their decision-making processes. The tool is used in multiple states and jurisdictions, including New York, Wisconsin, California, and Florida&#39;s Broward County. Over <a target="_blank" href='https://chicagopolicyreview.org/2019/03/12/can-an-algorithm-identify-repeat-offenders/'>1 million defendants</a> have had their information processed by the algorithm since its inception in 1998.</p>
    <p>In 2016, COMPAS came under national scrutiny when ProPublica published their now-famous article &quot;<a target="_blank" href='https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing'>Machine Bias</a>.&quot; The piece argued that the COMPAS algorithm was biased against African American defendants, as black defendants were twice as likely as white ones to be incorrectly labelled as &quot;high-risk.&quot; These accusations led to a response from <a target="_blank" href='https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2998391-ProPublica-Commentary-Final-070616.html'>COMPAS&#39;s creators</a> and <a target="_blank" href='http://www.crj.org/assets/2017/07/9_Machine_bias_rejoinder.pdf'>various</a> <a target="_blank" href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04711.pdf'>academics</a>. The controversy even attracted national media attention in the <a target="_blank" href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/17/can-an-algorithm-be-racist-our-analysis-is-more-cautious-than-propublicas/'>Washington Post</a>.</p>
    <p>Such discussions led many to ask: <em>How does COMPAS work?</em> (<a target="_blank" href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00731.pdf'>A common criticism</a> levelled against these algorithms is that we never really know.) The algorithm is powered by a <a target="_blank" href='https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2702103-Sample-Risk-Assessment-COMPAS-CORE.html'>137-question survey</a>. For each case, the algorithm considers a variety of factors such as offense history, age, sex, and neighborhood context. </p>
    <p>But how effective is COMPAS? In 2018, <a target="_blank" href='https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/1/eaao5580'>two researchers</a> evaluated the algorithm&#39;s relative accuracy in predicting two-year recidivism rates. They did so by asking untrained and unfamiliar subjects to look at a subset of features—seven, to be exact—and to predict that same recidivism rate. Their findings? These &quot;random&quot; participants performed as well as or <em>better</em> than COMPAS did. <span style = "font-weight:400">While COMPAS correctly guessed future activity 65% of the time, human participants had prediction accuracy of 67%.</span></p>
    <p>How do you compare? Below, I&#39;ll show you <em>five</em> characteristics (132 less than COMPAS uses). Use that information to guide your decision as to whether the defendant at hand will recidivate in the next two years or not. <span style = "font-weight:400">Are you smarter than COMPAS?</span></p>
