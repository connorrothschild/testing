Hi, I'm Connor! This website (my first version) is now archived, and everything you read below is likely outdated. I've transitioned to a new website, which you can find here](https://www.connorrothschild.com/)! 

I'm a junior at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) studying Social Policy Analysis & Political Science and minoring in data science. 

I'm interested in data visualization and public policy (and their intersection!), and my go-to tools for exploring those topics are D3.js and R.

This website hosts all of my technical writings. I encourage you to check out my [data visualization portfolio](https://connorrothschild.github.io/visualizations), which includes projects made in [R](https://connorrothschild.github.io/r) and [D3.js](https://connorrothschild.github.io/d3js).

If you'd like a more holistic view of my portfolio (not just code stuff!), you can check out my [CV](https://connorrothschild.github.io/markdown-cv/).

## üìç What I‚Äôm Doing Now

Right now, I'm working as an intern for the [Texas Policy Lab](https://www.texaspolicylab.org/profile/connor-rothschild/), a research fellow for the [Religion and Public Life Program at Rice University](https://rplp.rice.edu/staff-and-fellows), and a data science fellow with [Bluebonnet Data](https://www.bluebonnetdata.com).

I'm actively trying to learn Python, JavaScript, and how to get a summer internship in data visualization üôÇ. For fun, I'm studying a bit of theology and exercise science.

I'm currently reading [these books üìö](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/91140862?shelf=currently-reading), listening to [this music üéµ](https://open.spotify.com/user/12127359561), and watching [these movies üçø](https://letterboxd.com/connorroth/).
